					2 At the beginning of the story, the fictional nation of Norland declares war. The British public is not greatly alarmed, because Norland seems to be an inconsequential opponent. Norland's submarines effect a blockade, sinking all merchant ships that venture near England. Once the blockade of merchant ships is complete, they take the next step, sinking the Olympic, a massive luxury passenger vessel. The Norland technology is sufficiently advanced that the navy can do this with a single torpedo. England surrenders.
